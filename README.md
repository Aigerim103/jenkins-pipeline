## ✅ Example Jenkins Pipeline

A separate Jenkins pipeline repository ([jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/Aigerim103/jenkins-pipeline)) contains the `Jenkinsfile` for this project.

The pipeline does the following:

- Clones this repo
- Sets version and writes to `version.txt`
- Builds and runs Docker containers
- Performs health check
- Sends email notifications
- Performs rollback on failure
